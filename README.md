# Structure-from-motion-python
Implementation based on SFMedu Princeton COS429: Computer Vision http://vision.princeton.edu/courses/SFMedu/ but on python + numpy

The objective of this project was to understand  the structure from motion problem so i take the MATLAB code from http://vision.princeton.edu/courses/SFMedu/
and translate it in python + numpy. The initial version is just a literal translation from the MATLAB code to python (so expect higher run times, if you want a fast and easy to use software see http://ccwu.me/vsfm/)
